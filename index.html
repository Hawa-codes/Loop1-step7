            <p><span>T</span>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite <br> sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even <br> though most people donâ€™t take the time to find someone <br> who truly respects them. It seems like people are just <br> looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of <br> attention, settling for something much less than respect. I <br> am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship <br> grow is by showing respect.</p>
            <p> I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be <br> respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone <br> extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to <br> show them how highly they are valued.</p>
